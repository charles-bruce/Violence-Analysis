# Violence-Analysis
This project explores violence in Nigeria. It identifies factors linked to high fatalities (e.g., event types, actors) via data exploration and visualizations. It also builds Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict violence escalation, optimizing performance through feature engineering and tuning.
